# Calculator with Sound 🧮🎶

## What’s This?

This is my **mini project**—a fun little calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**! You can punch in numbers, hit some buttons, and get answers—all with a satisfying **beep** sound. Simple, stylish, and a bit playful!

## How It Works

-   Tap numbers and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to build your math.
-   Hit `=` to see the magic happen.
-   Press `C` to wipe it clean—beep included!

## Tech Inside

-   **HTML**: Builds the calculator layout.
-   **CSS**: Makes it look sleek and modern.
-   **JavaScript**: Handles the math and that cool beep sound.

## Try It Out

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/shishirshettyyy/calulator.git
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
3.  Start calculating—no installation needed!

## Neat Bits

-   **Sound Effect**: Every click goes beep—thanks to a little audio trick.
-   **Clean Design**: Smooth grid layout with hover vibes.
-   **Error Handling**: Mess up? It just says “Error” and keeps going.

## Challenges I Tackled

-   Syncing the beep sound to feel just right.
-   Keeping the `eval` math safe and simple.

## What’s Next?

-   Maybe some fancy animations.
-   A dark mode twist.
